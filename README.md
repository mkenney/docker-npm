### Tagged Docker Images

Images are tagged according to the installed Node version and operating system. Package versions are not pinned, instead [`npm`](https://npmjs.org/) is executed to install current versions of each package. If stability issues aries, I will pin package versions in a `Dockerfile` for that Node/OS version and create a image tagged as `stable` based on it. Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you run into this situation.

* [`alpine`, `latest` Dockerfile](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/alpine/Dockerfile)

  [![Layers](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/mkenney/npm:latest.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/mkenney/npm:latest)
  This image is under development and may not be as stable as versioned images. This image is based on a recent version of [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) and compiles a recent version of `node` from source.

* [`node-8-alpine` Dockerfile](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/node-8-alpine/Dockerfile)

### About

Essentially, this is just a set of [shell scripts](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/tree/master/bin) that manage a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) docker image. The docker image includes a script ([`run-as-user`](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-scripts/tree/master/container)) that allows commands to write files as either the current user or the owner/group of the current directory, which the shell scripts take advantage of to make sure files are created with your preferred permissions rather than root.

#### Images & Wrapper Scripts

The [images](https://hub.docker.com/r/mkenney/npm/tags/) contain the current stable `node` and `npm` binaries for [`debian:wheezy`](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/) and [`alpine:3.4`](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/). `npm` has been used to install various build tools globally. When using the [shell scripts](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/tree/master/bin) available in the [source repository](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm), the current directory is mounted into `/src` inside the container and a [wrapper script](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-scripts/blob/master/container/run-as-user) executes the specified command as a user who's `uid` and `gid` matches those properties on that directory. This way any output is written as the directory owner/group instead of root or a random user.

The included [`run-as-user`](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-scripts/tree/master/container) script has three methods of determining which `uid` and `gid` to execute as:

* By default, it will execute with a `uid` and `gid` that matches the current directory (the one that gets mounted into `/src`).
* In order to take advantage of public key authentication when installing packages from private repositories, all the wrapper scripts will attempt to mount your `~/.ssh` directory into the container. When that is successful, the script will run as the `uid` and `gid` of the owner of `~/.ssh` (you).

  Most software that takes advantage of public key authentication protocols do so over SSH, and by default, send the current user name as the login name. Because this process is executing out of a segregated container, it knows nothing about the current user's name and will instead try to login as a user named `dev`. In order to work around this, you need to create a SSH configuration that specifies the correct username.

  In your `~/.ssh` folder create a file called `config`. In that file you need to specify the correct username. For example, to specify your login name for all hosts:

  ```txt
  Host *
      User mkenney
  ```

  You can easily be more explicit as well, specifying by host or with additional wildcards. [Google is your friend](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ssh+config+file).

  ```txt
  Host github.com
      User mkenney
  ```

* You can also explicitly specify the `uid` and `gid` to use at runtime by defining the `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables when executing the container, this is quite useful in automated build systems:

  ```bash
  docker run \
      --rm \
      -it \
      -v $(pwd):/src:rw \
      -e "PUID=<user id>" \
      -e "PGID=<group id>" \
      mkenney/npm:latest <commands>
  ```

The included [wrapper scripts](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/bin) default to the latest node version and image tag I feel is stable, I will update the default tag as updates are released or stability issues warrant (`node-8-alpine` at the moment).

To specify a different image, you can define the image tag in your environment which will set a new default (you probably want to define this in your `.bashrc` or similar profile script):
```txt
export DOCKER_NPM_TAG=node-6.9-alpine
```

or you can easily specify it at runtime whenever necessary, for example:
```txt
$ DOCKER_NPM_TAG=node-6.9-alpine bower install
```

If you would to see like additional node modules and/or wrapper scripts added to this project please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) or [open a pull request](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/pull/new/master).

#### Installation

This assumes that you already have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed. A running `docker` daemon is required. You probably want to be able to [run docker commands without sudo](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/), but even if you excute the scripts with sudo files will be written with the appropriate `uid` and `gid`.

Wrapper scripts for several commands are available in the source repository:

* [`bower`](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/bin/bower)
* [`generate-md`](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/bin/generate-md)
* [`grunt`](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/bin/grunt)
* [`gulp`](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/bin/gulp)
* [`node`](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/bin/node)
* [`npm`](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/bin/npm)
* [`yarn`](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/bin/yarn)

Installation is just a matter of putting them somewhere in your path and making them executable. An [installation script](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/bin/install.sh) is available and can be executed with a shell `curl`+`sh -s` command. Simply pass in your command arguments normally.

```
Usage
  install.sh COMMAND [TAG [PREFIX]]

Synopsys
  Install a mkenney/npm container execution script locally

Options
  COMMAND  - Required, the name of the command to install (bower, gulp, npm, etc.)
  TAG      - Optional, the image tag to use. Default 'latest'
  PREFIX   - Optional, the location to install the command script. Default '$HOME/bin'

Examples
  $ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkenney/docker-npm/master/bin/install.sh | bash -s gulp node-8-alpine $HOME/bin
  $ bash ./install.sh gulp node-8-alpine $HOME/bin
```

##### Updating

* `[command] self-update`

  Each of the scripts have a `self-update` command which pulls down the latest docker image (which all the scripts share) and then updates the shell script itself. If you don't have write permissions on the shell script you'll get a permissions error, you can run the self-update command with `sudo` if necessary.

### Change log

#### 2018-05-20

* Added Node v9 images
* Refactored Alpine images to use Node official base images to improve build times (docker hub builds timeout after an hour)
* General `Dockerfile` cleanup and refactoring

#### 2017-10-01

Refactored the release-branch workflow into a feature-branch workflow. This will make updates across tagged images much simpler, less time consuming, and take less effort. As a result the maintenance of the wrapper scripts had to change by either maintaining a copy for each tagged image or consolidating them somehow. I chose the latter, defauting them to the latest stable tagged image (`node-8-alpine` at this time) and added support for specifying an alternate image throgh an environment variable.

To specify a default image, define it's tag in your environment (best to put it in your `.bashrc` or similar profile script):
```bash
export DOCKER_NPM_TAG="node-6.9-alpine"
```

or at runtime:
```bash
$ DOCKER_NPM_TAG="node-6.9-alpine" npm install
```

This is supported by all the wrapper scripts. I will update the default image tag as new node versions are released or stability issues arise.

I also refactored the test and CI integration scripts a bit to simplify that process and to work with the new directory structure. I'm not sure how that will play out with the Jenkins-CI build timeout issue.

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you notice any stability issues with this release.

#### 2017-04-12

Added support for specifying the user and group ids you want to run your container commands to the `/run-as-user` script via `docker run` execution: https://github.com/mkenney/docker-scripts/pull/1/files

To use this behavior, you can pass `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables when you execute the container:

```bash
  docker run \
      --rm \
      -it \
      -v $(pwd):/src:rw \
      -e "PUID=<user id>" \
      -e "PGID=<group id>" \
      mkenney/npm:latest <commands>
```

Also added support for using the `/run-as-user` script as an entrypoint and updated this `Dockerfile` to use it as an entrypoint, hopefully simplifying and clairifying `docker run` statements. This should not be a breaking change for any scripts that were taking advantage of the `CMD` behavior. https://github.com/mkenney/docker-scripts/pull/2/files

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you have any problems.

#### 2016-11-13

* Created "stable" branches for node v6.9 images
* More performance updates to the CI integration

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you have any problems.

#### 2016-11-08

* Modified the `alpine`-based dockerfiles to retain the build tools

  This change increases the image size by ~45MB but its still around 1/2 the size of the `debian`-based images.

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you have any problems.

#### 2016-11-06

* Added an install script to easily install the command wrapper scripts locally
* Added `travis-ci` tests to test and validate both the installation script and the individual wrapper scripts
  * The install script is using `bash` instead of `sh` because the version of `sh` installed on `travis-ci` would constantly have a syntax error on the `usage` function definition, regardless of how it was defined. Both of these failed:

```sh
function usage {
    ...
}
```

```sh
usage() {
    ...
}
```

At some point I'll get that figured out and switch it back to `sh`.

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you have any problems.

#### 2016-11-03

* Added tty detection to the shell scripts to alter the way the container is executed with piped input.

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you have any problems.

#### 2016-11-02

* Upgraded `node` to 7.0.0 in the `alpine` image.
* Created "stable" branches for the 7.0 images
* Merged a [change to the wrapper scripts](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/pull/25) to resolve a [reported issue](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues/24). This change reverts the 2016-07-05 changes.

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you have any problems.

#### 2016-10-20

* Added support for the `yarn` package manager. [issue](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues/19), [pr](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/pull/20)

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you have any problems.

#### 2016-09-17

##### Tag changes, possibly breaking

* Because it produces a much smaller image, I have moved the Alpine build into the `master` branch and the Debian build into it's own `debian` branch and made corresponding changes on [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/mkenney/npm/).
* Added the `--allow-root` option to the `bower` script to resolve [issue #4](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues/4).
* Merged [a PR](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/pull/5) to prevent ssl certificate issues in `self-update` commands.
* Updated the `self-update` command in the scripts to resolve [issue #8](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues/8).

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you have any problems.

#### 2016-08-29

* Added a markdown-to-html generator for static documentation ([`markdown-styles`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-styles)) and a script to run it ([`generate-md`](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/bin/generate-md)).
* Removed the dev user from the root group, the way it was setup new files were owned by root because it was the default group.

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if that change causes any issues.

#### 2016-07-13

* Re-structured automated the Docker Hub builds, they are no longer triggered by GitHub pushes. Instead they are triggered by a deployment script that is executed on successful `travis-ci` builds. This way, even if builds are failing the image on DockerHub should remain the last stable image at all times.
  * There may be an issue with API call throttling on the Docker Hub side, if that seems to be happening I'll dig in further.
* Fixed an issue with the path in the source URL that had been preventing successuful alpine builds for a few days.

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you have any problems.

#### 2016-07-05

* Fixed a string-comparison issue on logins where the default shell is Bourne shell rather than Bourne again shell.

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you have any problems.

#### 2016-06-29

* Added updating `npm` to the latest stable version in the `debian` image.
* Changed to compiling `node` from source in the `alpine` image because the version installed by `n` was compiled with a different prefix than the `apk` packages which made a mess. I set the build to use the same install prefix as the `node:latest` image (`/usr/local`).
* Added some simple checks to the travis-ci configuration to catch the 2016-06-28 issue with the missing `shadow` package.

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you run into any problems.

#### 2016-06-28

* `alpine:latest` doesn't have the `shadow` available (at the moment) so the `/run-as-user` script wasn't functioning correctly. Added the `edge/testing` repo, installed `shadow` and also went ahead and updated `npm` to the latest available version (`3.10.2`).

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you run into any problems.

#### 2016-06-23

* Added `bower` to the image and a [wrapper script](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/bin/bower) to the repository.
* Added a `node` [wrapper script](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/blob/master/bin/node) to the repository.
* Added mounting your `~/.ssh/` directory into the container to support access to private repositories. If that directory is mounted, then `npm` and `bower` will run as the `uid`/`gid` that owns that `~/.ssh/` directory (hopefully you), otherwise it will run as the project directories `uid` and `gid` as usual.
* Updated all the wrapper scripts to use variables for the image tag and github branch to make merges simpler
* Created a [tagged](https://hub.docker.com/r/mkenney/npm/tags/) version of the image based on [`alpine:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/)

Please [let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you run into any problems.

#### 2016-06-06

* Modified the `run-as-user` script so that it doesn't require specifying which user account in the container should be modified
  * Instead, always modify the `dev` user. This required updating both the image and the wrapper scripts, if you use the wrapper scripts you should run:
    * `sudo npm self-update`
    * `sudo gulp self-update`
    * `sudo grunt self-update`

#### 2016-06-03

Removed the `as-user` script (and renamed it `run-as-user`) and put it in a [separate repo](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-scripts/tree/master/container) as it's used in several images. [Let me know](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/issues) if you have any trouble, this is the first image I've switched over.

#### 2016-05-25

##### Breaking changes

Added a wrapper script to the container that executes `npm`, `gulp` and `grunt` commands as a user who's `uid` and `gid` matches those properties on the current directory. This way any files are installed as the directory owner/group instead of root or a random user.

If you've been using the [previous version](https://github.com/mkenney/docker-npm/tree/deprecated/bin) of the included shell scripts from the project's `/bin` directory you will probably need to update the permissions of files created using them or the new scripts are likely to have permissions errors because previously the files would have been created by the `root` user. This command should take care of it for you but _make sure you understand what it will do **before** you run it_. I can't help you if you hose your system.

* From your **_project directory_**: `sudo chown -R $(stat -c '%u' .):$(stat -c '%g' .) ./`

If you haven't been using the included scripts, then you don't need to do anything.
